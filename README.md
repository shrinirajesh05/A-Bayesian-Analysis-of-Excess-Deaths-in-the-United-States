# A Bayesian Analysis of Excess Deaths in the United States

Overview:

This project provides an in-depth examination of excess mortality in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on all-cause excess deaths between 2020 and 2022. By applying Bayesian statistics and a multiple regression framework, the study aims to estimate excess deaths and uncover key factors contributing to increased mortality. The dataset used spans weekly estimates of observed versus expected deaths, covering various regions in the U.S. and offering insights into the pandemic's broader mortality impact.

Dataset Description:

The dataset includes weekly estimates of excess deaths across different U.S. regions. Excess mortality is defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected mortality during a specific period. The dataset:

Covers all-cause deaths, including those attributed directly to COVID-19 and those not directly tied to the virus.
Utilizes the Farrington surveillance algorithm to calculate excess deaths, adjusting for incomplete data and accounting for expected variations in mortality.
Provides provisional estimates that help illuminate potential underreporting of COVID-19 deaths and explore the broader consequences of the pandemic.

Objectives:

This study applies Bayesian statistical methods to:

Estimate all-cause excess mortality across the U.S. over three years, focusing on regional trends.
Identify patterns and relationships contributing to excess mortality using a multiple regression framework.
Predict excess mortality for 2022 using models trained on data from 2020 to 2021.
Evaluate model predictions by comparing them with actual mortality data to identify regional or state-specific trends.

Methodology:
Bayesian Statistics: A probabilistic approach is employed to model and estimate excess mortality across U.S. regions.
Multiple Regression Framework: This technique is used to analyze factors influencing excess mortality and to predict mortality trends.
State Grouping: To make the analysis scalable and capture broader regional trends, states are grouped into regions rather than analyzed individually.
Prediction for 2022: The model trained on 2020 and 2021 data is used to make predictions for excess deaths in 2022. These predictions are then critically compared with actual data to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Key Features:

Data-Driven Insights: The analysis seeks to understand the full scope of mortality during the pandemic, beyond the direct attributions to COVID-19.
Regional Focus: By grouping states into regions, the analysis captures broader geographic trends, revealing regional disparities in excess mortality.
Model Validation: Post-modeling comparisons with actual mortality data provide a validation check for predictions, ensuring that the findings are both accurate and insightful.

Conclusions:
This study enhances our understanding of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic by:

Applying advanced Bayesian techniques to provide nuanced estimates of excess deaths.
Highlighting regional differences and commonalities in mortality trends.
Contributing to the growing body of knowledge in the field of mortality analysis during unprecedented times.

How to Use the Data:

Data Access: The dataset used for this analysis is provisional and may be updated as more accurate information becomes available.
Analysis Replication: Users interested in replicating the analysis can follow the Bayesian regression methods applied in this study to explore further insights.
